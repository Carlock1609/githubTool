## Github Web Application Tool

## Description
### This is a tool being built for instructors/TA's to make daily duties of keeping track of students progress, as well as checking student commits

## IDEA'S
### - Should I keep it simple and just use postman to make POST requests for adding students? I can leave instructions on README for use.

## TODO's
### - Figure out how to split the tables by class name. - Use something like orderBy, it should atleast group them by their given Class name
### - An admin auth needs to be added for easier adding of students. - One shared login the TA/Instructors use.

## FINISHED
### - Cron job done, set to run at 12:00am everyday - fix up code, update date www to not make that call anymore.
### - 07/30 FIGURE OUT STATE ISSUE - Trying to map prop being passed from parent, component is mapping before data is loaded.
### - Figure out loading while the async is being processed.
